# Orchard Dojo Library



The Orchard Dojo Library is a portable package of Orchard goodies. It supplements [Orchard Dojo](http://orcharddojo.net)'s trainings and tutorials. For accessing the Library from the web, go to [orcharddojo.net/orchard-resources/Library/](http://orcharddojo.net/orchard-resources/Library/) (you can also download the Library's textual content as a single document form there). The Library's project page is under [source.lombiq.com/orchard-dojo-library](http://source.lombiq.com/orchard-dojo-library).

The Orchard Dojo Library is backed by the team behind Orchard Dojo, [Lombiq](http://lombiq.com).

The Orchard Dojo Library is available in two public source repositories, automatically mirrored in both directions with [Git-hg Mirror](https://githgmirror.com):

- [https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/orchard-dojo-library](https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/orchard-dojo-library) (Mercurial repository)
- [https://github.com/Lombiq/Orchard-Dojo-Library](https://github.com/Lombiq/Orchard-Dojo-Library) (Git repository)
