# Extended APIs



The knowledge of the below APIs is not necessary for all developers as these are needed only for more special tasks.

- Common Orchard provider model
- Form provider
- Projector providers:
	- Filter provider
	- Sort criteria provider
	- Layout provider
- Token provider
- Rules providers (to be changed to Workflow after Orchard 1.7):
	- Event providers
	- Action providers
- Creating an admin theme
- Advanced shapes:
	- Shape events
	- Shape table providers
	- Shape methods
- Overriding Orchard services with OrchardSuppressDependency

There is no need to go into details about Rules providers, evaluating a few provider types used in Projector and a Token provider is enough.
