# Inline Documentation Guidelines



- Don’t overdo documentation as it can do more harm than use when going out of date, what it tends to do.
- Always document complex pieces of logic by briefly explaining what the code does and why.
- Always document unusual solutions, hacks or workarounds and explain why they are necessary.
- It’s advised to document interfaces, best with usage samples.
