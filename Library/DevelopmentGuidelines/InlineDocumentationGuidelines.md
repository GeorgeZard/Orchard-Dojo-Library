# Inline documentation guidelines



- Don’t overdo documentation as it can do more harm than use when going out of date, what it tends to do.
- Always document complex pieces of logic by briefly explaining what the code does and why.
- Always document unusual solutions, hacks or workarounds and explain why they are necessary.
- It’s advised to document interfaces, best with usage samples. This is especially true for services: always document services, as these are commonly used by other developers too.
- Never use comments for mental notes (like "TODO"). Such notes should go into more appropriate places like an issue tracker, some common documentation or something else.
- Documentation should be as close to what it documents as possible to avoid going out of date.
- It's good to document what the aim of a type (mostly class or interface) is. This is to be able to quickly understand what a type does without having to understand its code.
- Write documentation as you write code: use correct grammar and punctuation (remember that comments are sentences), apply to style conventions.
