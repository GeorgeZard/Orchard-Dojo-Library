# Code Styling

- If there length of the parameter list for a method is too long to read conveniently in terms of line length (due to the 3-argument rule this should rarely happen for methods but constructors with dependency injection) break it into multiple lines parameter by parameter.
- Keep logical blocks of codes separated by multiple line breaks, forming logical “islands”.
- Brace styling
- Order of members: private, public, static (const), inner class
- If an expression is short, omit line breaks when applicable (e.g. with short properties, short if-clauses).
