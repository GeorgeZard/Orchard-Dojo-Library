# Content field



Content fields are bits of information that can store basic data, like the common .NET classes, e.g. strings, integers and dates.

Content fields can be attached to a content part in any quantity you like (either by code - in a migration or on the Admin UI), just make sure every field has a unique name.

In case you are attaching a content field to a content type on the Admin UI, the fields are attached to a ghost-content part with the same as the content type (if the content type doesn't already have a content part with the same name).
