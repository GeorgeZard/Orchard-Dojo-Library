# Orchard Dojo Library Contribution Guidelines



The Orchard Dojo Library is fully open source and can be edited by anyone. If you found an error or would like to improve it you're more than welcome; just submit a pull request!

The Library is stored in a repository on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/orchard-dojo-library). The same [guidelines](http://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Documentation-style-guidelines) apply as to the Orchard documentation except that documents here not only can but are required to have a leading first-level title.

- Name files and folders with PascalCasing.
- You can use relative links to link between files; paths are the same online as they are in the repository.
- Add 3 line breaks after an H1, 2 before (if it's not immediately after an H1) and 1 after an H2.
