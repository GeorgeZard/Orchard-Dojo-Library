# Orchard Dojo Library Contribution Guidelines



The Orchard Dojo Library is fully open source and can be edited by anyone. If you found an error or would like to improve it you're more than welcome; just submit a pull request!

The Library is stored as Markdown-formatted text files in a repository on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/orchard-dojo-library). The files can be edited with any text editor but we prefer the excellent [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/).

- The same [guidelines](http://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Documentation-style-guidelines) apply as to the Orchard documentation except that documents here not only can but are required to have a leading first-level title.
- Name files and folders with PascalCasing.
- Files named Index.md are automatically opened when requesting their folder.
- You can use relative links to link between files; paths are the same online as they are in the repository. Keep in mind that links to folders (when the Index file is opened automatically) must end with a slash (/) while links to files shouldn't.
- Add 3 line breaks after an H1, 2 before (if it's not immediately after an H1) and 1 after an H2.
