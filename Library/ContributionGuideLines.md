# Orchard Dojo Library Contribution Guidelines



The Orchard Dojo Library is fully open source and can be edited by anyone. If you found an error or would like to improve it you're more than welcome; just submit a pull request!

The Library is stored in a repository on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/Lombiq/orchard-dojo-library). The same [guidelines](http://docs.orchardproject.net/Documentation/Documentation-style-guidelines) apply as to the Orchard documentation except that documents here not only can but are required to have a leading first-level title.
