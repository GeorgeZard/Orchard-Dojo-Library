# Module development and Orchard APIs (training topic)



The below topics are the core of what an Orchard developer should know. Other, less important items are listed under [Extended APIs](../ExtendedApis/).


- [Getting started with module development](GettingStartedWithModuleDevelopment)
- [Basic techniques in module development](BasicTechniquesInModuleDevelopment)
- [Developing custom content](DevelopingCustomContent)
- [Intermediate techniques in module development](IntermediateTechniquesInModuleDevelopment)
- [Advanced techniques in module development](AdvancedTechniquesInModuleDevelopment)
- [Complementary topics of module development](ComplementaryTopicsInModuleDevelopment)


## Addendum

We've created a demo module for the purpose of teaching all the topics here with well explained examples, the [Orchard Training Demo module](https://github.com/Lombiq/Orchard-Training-Demo-Module). The training topics here loosely follow the Training Demo. If you want to use the Training Demo as a reference when giving a training, even copy-pasting from it then the [Comment Remover](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.CommentRemover) Visual Studio extension can come handy: You can remove the Training Demo's comments so they're not clutter while you explain the same thing.
