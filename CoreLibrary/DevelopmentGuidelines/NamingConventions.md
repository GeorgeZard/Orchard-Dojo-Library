# Naming conventions



- Use the suffix “Base” for abstract classes.
- Suffix [part classes](../Wiki/ContentPart) with "Part".
- Name js and css files with the segments of their names delimited by dashes, e.g. *my-style.css*.
- Resource names declared in [resource manifests](../Wiki/ResourceManifest) are also global so prefix them with the module's name e.g. "MyModule.MyStyle".
